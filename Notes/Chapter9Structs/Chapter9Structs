I. Struct group items that are related but of different types
    - A collection of a fixed number of components in which the components are accessed by name
    - Members of the struct (name of components)
    Single variable can pass all the components as parameters to a function
    struct structName
    {
    dataType1 identifier1;
    dataType2 identifier2;
    };

    Struct is a definition, not a declaration - only a data type; no memory is allocated.
    Define datatype: Exp: houseType newHouse;

II. Accessing struct Members
    Using the array name together with the relative position (index) of the component.
    structVariableName.memberName
    the dot (.) is called the member access operator.
